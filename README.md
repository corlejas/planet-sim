# planet-sim
Simulate planets in ChatGPT.  Used as part of a demonstration of the power of GPT4 in 2023

I wanted to demonstrate the power of ChatGPT at this early point in its lifecycle.  My goal was to show that a machine could build and use its own tool - just like humans did when we developed beyond animals.  However I think we've got even better than that with this demonstration as ChatGPT can create a virtual reality within its realm and run simulations against it.  This would be incredibly hard for us humans to code without access to vast quantities of data, and configuring relationships between the data sets - ChatGPT does it in the time it takes for it to respond to your input!  The best part of this is that ChatGPT suggested doing this when I first enetered into conversation with it about how we can demonstarte this concept of the machine building and using its own tool.

I have run all this in GPT4, but Im sure GPT3.5 will also work, albeit with less efficacy and mnore hallucination.

This repo is compsoed of the following files:

-  *Planet Definition Prompts.pdf* is the conversation I had with ChatGPT that created the defintions of the three planets.  It includes a couple of questions that run simulations as I began to understand the capabilities tied up in this approach.
-  *Planet Defintions.txt* these are the three planets as defined by ChatGPT, that you can insert into prompts to start a new simulation.
-  *Planet Image Prompts.pdf* is the conversation I had with ChatGPT4 with the DALL-E3 extension to generate the images of the planets.
-  *Primordis.png* is the DALL-E3 representation of Primordis.
-  *Terranova.png* is the DALL-E3 representation of Terranova.
-  *Verdantia.png* io the DALL-E3 representation of Verdantia.
